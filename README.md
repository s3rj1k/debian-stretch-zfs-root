# debian-stretch-zfs-root
Installs Debian GNU/Linux 9 Stretch to a native ZFS root filesystem using a [Debian Stretch Live CD](https://www.debian.org/CD/live/). Installation with a Debian Jessie Live CD is supported as well, ZFS packages from [backports.org](https://backports.debian.org/) will be used in this case.

## Usage

1. Boot [Stretch Live CD](https://www.debian.org/CD/live/) ('standard' edition)
1. Login (user: `user`, password: `live`) and become root
1. Setup network and export `http_proxy` environment variable (if needed)
1. Run this script
1. User interface: Select disks and RAID level
1. Let the installer do the work
1. User interface: install grub to *all* disks participating in the array
1. User interface: enter root password and select timezone
1. Reboot

## Fixes included

* grub (v2.02, included in Debian 9), especially `grub-probe`, [does not support](https://github.com/zfsonlinux/grub/issues/19) [all ZFS features](http://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?42861) and subsequently [refuses to install](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/grub2/+bug/1451476). This script disables `feature@hole_birth` and `feature@embedded_data` (and you _must_ _not_ enable those features after installation).
* Some mountpoints, notably `/var`, need to be mounted via fstab as the ZFS mount script runs too late during boot.
* No EFI support at all.

## Bugs

* During installation you might encounter some SPL package errors ([`Please make sure the kmod spl devel package is installed`](https://github.com/hn/debian-stretch-zfs-root/issues/2)) which can be ignored safely.
* `grub-install` mysteriously fails for disk numbers >= 4 (`grub-install: error: cannot find a GRUB drive for /dev/disk/by-id/...`).
